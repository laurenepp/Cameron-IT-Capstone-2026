Cameron IT Capstone 2026

>> Project Overview

This repository contains the development work for the Riverside Family Clinic’s standalone patient intake and appointment management system. The system is being built as part of the 2026 IT Capstone project and will be deployed using UniServerZ in an offline clinic environment.

The goal: Replace paper forms, streamline patient intake, and make sure nothing catches on fire during the final demo.

>> Repository Structure

This repo is organized to keep all teams from accidentally stepping on each other’s toes. Folders are intentionally empty at the start; teams will populate them as development progresses.
* /clinic        → PHP pages for the system (index, login, dashboard, etc.)

* /assets        → CSS, JS, images, and other front-end resources

* /partials      → Reusable components (header, footer, nav)

* /database      → SQL schema, seed data, and DB documentation

* /docs          → Requirements, design docs, user/admin guides
